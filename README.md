### Setup python environment

- Make sure [python is installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
- Run the setup.bat file. It will create a virtual environment and setup all the needed packages.
- If you get "Permission denied error" or "Access denied error" while running the setup.bat for first time, open an elevated command prompt (**Run as Administrator**), navigate to the SuperfastAccess directory and execute setup.bat.

## RUN THE SCRIPT

- Make sure that the entire setup is complete as above. Simply double click run.bat file and everything should work fine. If you end up in some errors related to python then you probably need to check your python installation.
